Exerceise For Software Engineers getting started in the Machine Intelligence Laboatory
======================================================================================

Goal of These Exercises
-----------------------
These are exercise which try to give software engineers in the Machine Intelligence laboratroy real world experience with our development and testing patterns for < $100.

The exercises are also meant to be done in order.

Overarching Philosophy
----------------------
These exercises follow the philosophy: "If you didn't do it, you didn't learn anything."

General Procedure For An Exercise
---------------------------------
In each exercise you will be given a working code base, which is the final product.


Do not read the functional files as you will be asked to remove them and use the provided skeleton code to make your own version in place.


You will use the ROS command line diagnostic tools to investigate the system and answer basic questions (self grading, the answers are at the end of each exercise).


Then, you will be asked to remove each functional file, write your own version of it, and verify against the rest of the system that already exists.
